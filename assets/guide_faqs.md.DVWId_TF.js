Third party RSS service providers such as Feedly and Inoreader, strip this attribute off, resulting in cross-domain requests being blocked. Meanwhile, the attribute is not available for videos yet, resulting in most RSS readers unable to pass the anti-hotlink check. Here are some workarounds:</p><ol><li>Migrate to RSS readers that do not send Refererï¼Œsuch as <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Inoreader for Web</a> with a <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/376884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">user script disabling Referer</a>, <a href="https://greasyfork.org/scripts/463461-fix-image-error-at-inoreader" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">fix-image-error at inoreader</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Rongronggg9/RSS-to-Telegram-Bot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RSS to Telegram Bot</a>, etc. If your RSS reader can bypass the anti-hotlink check successfully and play embedded videos, it&#39;s an RSS reader that do not send Referer.
